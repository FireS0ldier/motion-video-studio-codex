# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Codex edition

This repository is the Codex edition of [motion-video-studio](https://github.com/FireS0ldier/motion-video-studio).

- **`AGENTS.md` is the full agent guide** (Codex loads it automatically; under 24 KiB, well within the 32 KiB Codex reads from a project's `AGENTS.md` files). `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/` are removed.
- **Skills in `.agents/skills/`**, where Codex discovers project skills; they mention `view_image` for the visual review.
- **`.codex/config.toml`:** network for the sandbox and the recommended model (`gpt-6.1-sol`, reasoning effort `high`); Codex applies it once the project is trusted.
- **`.gitattributes`:** LF line endings everywhere, so the setup script and the tests also work on Windows checkouts.
- **[docs/codex.md](docs/codex.md):** sandbox settings (`network_access`), writes outside the repository, macOS Chromium limitation, long-running commands, images, Codex Cloud (`tools/codex-cloud-setup.sh`, domains, VM sizes) and model choice.
- **Python caches in sandboxes:** when the user cache folder (`~/.cache`) is read-only, `voice` and `align` keep uv's environments and the Hugging Face/PyTorch caches in `.cache/python/` (variables you set are kept).
- Tests: `AGENTS.md` size, the Agent Skills format of every skill, relative links and headings in all docs, the cache fallback.

### Added

- **German voiceovers:** `mvs voice` uses Piper for German scripts (`language: de`), with four curated, checksum-pinned voices (`de_DE-thorsten-high` default, `thorsten-medium`, `thorsten_emotional-medium` with `--speaker`, `kerstin-low`). Their recordings are CC0, but the models were fine-tuned from English voices with non-commercial data terms, so commercial use is not clearly licensed (see docs/audio.md). Any other Piper voice id works too. New options `--engine kokoro|piper`, `--speaker`, `--seed`; `--list` shows both engines (`--list --voice <id>`: its speakers).
- **TTS word timing:** Piper voices report exact word times from the model's phoneme durations, mapped onto script words by phoneme alignment; `mvs voice` writes `data/voice.json` and `data/timing.json`, and `mvs align` reuses the report (`--engine tts`, chosen automatically while audio and script are unchanged). Takes written with `--out` elsewhere leave the project's timing alone.
- **Reproducible Piper reads:** the model's sampling noise is seeded, so the same script and `--seed` give a bit-identical WAV.
- **German script handling:** numbers (einundzwanzig, tausendzweihundertfünfzig, 3,5 → drei Komma fünf), signs, percent, currency, `3x` → dreimal, `30-tägige`, `80er`, dates (`1. Oktober` → ersten Oktober), times, `Mio.`/`Mrd.`, common abbreviations (z.B., d.h., bzw., ca., Dr., …) are spoken in full; WhisperX output in German is mapped with German number rules.
- **German starter template:** `mvs new <name> --language de` (template `starter-de`).

### Changed

- Domains in English and German scripts are read out (`orbit.dev` → orbit dot dev, `acme.de` → acme punkt de) and `%` is a spoken symbol; English scripts with bare domains get a new script hash, so `mvs check` asks for `mvs align` once.
- Symbols (`&`, `+`, `@`, `%`) are passed to the TTS as words and no longer break phrase lookups across them (`f.in('40 % weniger')`).
- Signed numbers keep their sign in English too (`+40%` → plus forty percent); the letters/digits fallback keeps non-ASCII letters.
- The no-uv Python fallback maps package names with extras to their modules (e.g. `piper-tts[alignment]` → `piper`, `onnx`).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-06

First release.

### Engine

- Scenes as pure functions of time (`defineScene`, `render(f, g)`), timelines anchored to voiceover words (`cut`, `section`, `word`, `end`), projects (`defineProject`) with format, brand, audio, cues and look.
- Graphics API on Canvas 2D: shapes, paths with draw-on, gradients, brand paints, shadows, groups with clipping, images, frame-exact screen recordings, Lucide icons, glow.
- Typography: brand type scale, balanced wrapping, kinetic presets (rise, fade, blur, mask, pop, slam, type, scramble, karaoke) by char/word/line, voice-synced reveals, animated marks, exits.
- WebGL2 compositor: 3D layers (perspective, rotation, depth, fake lighting), layer cache, Gaussian blur and depth of field, 2.5D camera with parallax planes, 11 transitions (cut, fade, dip, slide, push, zoom, wipe, iris, blur, glitch, whip), adaptive motion blur, bloom, chromatic aberration, grading, vignette, grain, dithering.
- Motion library: 35 named easings plus cubic-bezier, analytic springs, keyframes, interpolate, stagger, seeded noise/RNG, arced paths.
- Brand system with motion presets (smooth, snappy, bouncy, cinematic) and bundled fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono, Instrument Serif).
- Formats: landscape, vertical, square, 4:5, 4K, 30/60 fps, custom.

### Kit and templates

- Components: backgrounds (mesh, aurora, grid, dots, spotlight), particles, sheen, browser and phone frames, glass, cards, buttons with press states, pills, toggles, avatars, progress, checkmarks, toasts, cursor paths with clicks, bar/line/donut/ring charts, counters, code editor with highlighting and typing, terminal, captions, logo and logo reveal, headline block, camera moves (drift, punch, shake, move), responsive layout helpers.
- Templates: title, kinetic, quote, montage, showcase/screenshot/recording (3D card with callouts and zoom), phoneShowcase, features, stats, code, cta, logoScene.

### CLI (`mvs`)

- `setup`, `doctor`, `new`, `dev`, `info`, `voice`, `align`, `analyze`, `assets`, `sfx`, `mix`, `still`, `render`, `check`, `review`, `clean`.
- Headless rendering with parallel Chromium workers, binary frame sink, ordered ffmpeg encoding (H.264 BT.709), draft/final/4K presets, bit-identical output.
- Alignment engines: wav2vec2 CTC forced alignment (ONNX, CPU), WhisperX, heuristic, estimate.
- Audio: mixer with voice-driven ducking, peak-aligned SFX cues, BS.1770 loudness normalization (−14 LUFS), look-ahead limiter; analysis (envelope, onsets, silences, BPM, beats); local TTS with Kokoro-82M.
- Procedural, license-free SFX library (17 sounds) and music bed.
- `check`: stale timing, missing phrases/assets/sounds, crashes, blank frames, text outside the frame, slow scenes, non-deterministic code. `review`: contact sheet and per-scene/per-transition stills.

### Content

- Starter template (`mvs new`) with a complete six-scene product video.
- Demo project `orbit-launch`: 50 s 1080p60 launch film with voiceover, music and sound design.

### Docs and tooling

- README, CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md for AI agents, docs (workflow, scene API, kit and templates, script format, audio, rendering, motion guide, architecture, troubleshooting), Claude Code skills, CI (typecheck, unit tests, e2e render tests).
